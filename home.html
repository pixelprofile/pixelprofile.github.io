    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">Wow, we are so sorry it's been so long since we updated this site. Didn't update it at all throughout 2021. Not something we're proud of. Oh! But we have some updates! So we have a laptop now! This should help us a bit in updating the site, though updates probably won't really pick up until we're able to get our ADHD and depression meds. Also we're honestly thinking of just making a new website. This one, while cool, isn't really going anywhere and we want to try something else. :3 Stay tuned for updates on that, and thank you for your patience if you're still here! ~Nai</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">Dang, it's been <b><i>way</i></b> too long since we updated this site. We removed vaxx.us links because vaxx.us now leads to pop-ups and the Internet Archive's mirror doesn't seem to work right. We're not sure what to do with this site, though we want to do something with it. Oh, and if you're wondering why we're saying "we", see <a href="https://morethanone.info">morethanone.info</a>. ~Charlie</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">Sorry I haven’t updated the site in months. My Android tablet died fairly recently, and school has not exactly helped that situation, but I’ll try to at least add some more files to the site.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">As of now, I’m still unable to bring back the old 88x31 archive, though I’m considering just rebuilding it from the ground up. Other than that, I’m also going to be working on moving my Minecraft mod archive here and adding a ton of Better Than Wolves versions to it. The ROM dump news site is currently on hold, but rest assured, it’s not entirely dead. I still have backups of the page for it. Beyond that, I don’t have many plans for the near future of this website, though I might change up the UI a bit to move the guestbook from the bottom of the page, have an actual top bar that isn’t just a few links, and put more emphasis on the archive. No promises on when that’ll happen though.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">The move to GitHub.io was a success! Hopefully this will allow me to update the site more easily. I'm also working on a news site that reports on and documents new ROM dumps! I'll post the link to that once it's up.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>May 29th, 2019, 12:00 PM PDT</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">I'm currently looking into moving the site to glitch.me as GeoCities.ws is becoming more and more unstable. Hopefully this time I'll be able to stay with glitch.me for more than a few months. Wish me luck. I will post the URL soon.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>May 29th, 2019, 11:04 AM PDT</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">The update to the 88x31 button collection is going to take a bit longer than expected, as right now my family is in the process of moving, and the computer with all of the buttons on it is currently packed. However, I will update the Minecraft Scene Archive today with an Optimine/OptiFog/OptiFine archive, which as of now I can guarantee is the most complete OptiFine archive on the internet. Link is at <a href="/minecraft_scene_archive">https://pixelprofile.github.io/minecraft_scene_archive</a>.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #00ccff;">May 29th, 2019, 11:23 AM PDT Update:</span></em><span style="color: #00ccff;"> Updated archive.fo listing for guestbook, fixed timestamps to be PDT during Daylight Savings.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">I just added a vaxx.us link to the top of the page. The site is dedictated to debunking many myths spread by anti-vaxxers.<strong><br /></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">Remember how I said I have a domain now? Well for some reason my <strong>free domain</strong> expired after a day, so I don't have a proper domain anymore. Probably should've posted this sooner, but I got distracted with school and fixing my 88x31 button collection. I'm going to be updating that properly soon (<strong><tt>translation: about 1-2 months from now</tt></strong>) so stay tuned for that I guess.</span></span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">Sorry the blog is taking so long. I'm currently testing the interface. For now, have a music player! Request songs similar to the ones in the playlist in the guestbook or via my email!</span></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em>February 6th, 2019, 11:20 AM PST Update:</em> Never mind. Geocities.ws keeps breaking the music player by removing data-config code. I really need to get off this host.<br /></span></span></span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">Currently rolling out Wii cursor to all pages. Still working on blog. Also just realized I forgot about the 1 year anniversary for my website. Whoops.<strong><br /></strong></span></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>January 11th, 2019, 8:27 AM PST</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">You know how I said I'd turn this into a blog at some point? That's not happening. I decided to keep this as a changelog and have the blog seperate. At some point I want to renovate this page, but don't expect that to happen any time soon.<br /></span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">The repository is open now. The directory mirror of <a href="http://download.8bitdo.com">http://download.8bitdo.com</a> is currently incomplete due to Geocities.ws being annoying. I will try to fix the Pong game today.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em>January 8th, 2019 11:16 AM PST Update:</em> I give up trying to fix it for now. I know it's going to be more trouble than it's worth at the moment due to Geocities.ws changing the code to modernize it.<br /></span></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>January 6th, 2019, 12:20 PM PST</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">Sorry it's taking a bit for the repository to be set up. I'm going to start adding files now to justify opening it.<br /></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>December 21st, 2018, 4:15 PM PST</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">It's taking a bit longer than expected for me to find a good amount of interesting files to open up the repository. I should be able to open it soon. In the meantime, if you want to contribute to the repository, you can send obscure and interesting files to me at <a href="mailto:pixelprofile.neocities@gmail.com">pixelprofile.neocities@gmail.com</a>!</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>December 14th, 2018, 10:43 AM PST</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">This website finally has a reason to exist! I'm probably going to dump obscure files I find from across the internet onto this site. Once I get some files up, I'll make another post and put the page on the SiteMap. I also updated the front page so it looks better in larger windows (I've been stupidly testing this site in a smaller window for some reason; don't ask).</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;">Sorry for dropping off the map for a while. I finally fixed the website. It turns out Geocites.ws was automatically changing things like the &lt;font&gt; tags to modernize the code, breaking the site. I may switch webhosts again because of this, specifically to 000webhostapp. However, I want to know your guy's opinion. Here's a poll so you all can vote on it:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strawpoll.me/16810570">https://www.strawpoll.me/16810570</a></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em>November 9th, 2018, 8:27 AM PST Update:</em> The formatting for the above date is also being weird despite me using the same code as all of the dates. Sorry about that. Also, once this is decided, I will fix the Pong game.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em>November 9th, 2018, 8:40 AM PST Update:</em> Added archive.fo listing for guestbook, changed color of text. As a reminder, every update to the website itself is archived on archive.org (this includes the old site [<a href="https://pixelprofile.neocities.org">pixelprofile.neocites.org</a>]).<br /></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">September 14th, 2018, 10:25 AM PDT</span></strong><br /><span style="color: #00ccff;">I'm back! I'm not dead, I was just taking a break for a bit. I'll work on my web button archive some more soon (it's not just for 88x31 buttons anymore), the move to <a href="https://geocities.ws">Geocities.ws</a> was successful with the exception of the Pong game. I'll be fixing that soon and it'll be better than ever as I can finally add the sounds that I was unable to add to it on Neocities. As for the Nintendo Switch version, I'll have to fix that soon. I'm gonna be adding some actual blog posts soon. Maybe some information pages. The blog posts will mostly be informational anyway, so they may not be needed. See you all soon!</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">June 13th, 2018, 11:47 AM PDT</span></strong><br /><span style="color: #00ccff;">I'm planning on moving to <a href="https://geocities.ws">Geocities.ws</a> soon due to certain advantages the host has compared to Neocities (though I will miss the built-in IDE that Neocities has). I will archive the site and its contents and I will put the new URL on the index.html file. See you all soon!</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>May 29th, 2018, 12:55 PM PDT</strong></span><br /><span style="color: #00ccff;">I'm back on the site! Don't be surprised if I stop updating the site again though. I've been doing some other things recently, including building up an archive of Flash games that may or may not eventually be included in BlueMaxima's FlashPoint. In other news, Jeff Theplant from the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/takecareofmyplant">r/takecareofmyplant</a> subreddit has passed on. I will make a memorial for him soon. Good night, sweet prince. </span><br /><span style="color: #00ccff;">I should also take this moment to remind everyone that if you need to contact me, my email is <a href="mailto:pixelprofile.neocities@gmail.com">pixelprofile.neocities@gmail.com</a>. See you guys in at least a month (probably). </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em>May 31st, 2018, 9:24 AM PDT Update:</em> I probably won't be able to make the Jeff Theplant Memorial due to not having sufficient images.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">Sorry about not updating this site in a while. I am still alive and am currently working on the 88x31 archive. I might get to those major changes soon, but I can't make any promises. I also added article tags to this blog (which will still eventually be moved to a different tab and be used as an actual blog) and I'm going to add more metadata for search engines after I write this. If you have any suggestions, please put them in the guestbook. I'll try to update this site more often.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">January 30th, 2018, 5:22 PM PST</span></strong><br /><span style="color: #00ccff;">I think I'm going to make some major changes to this website soon, namely having a better interface and moving this blog (that's more like a changelog at the moment) to its own tab. For now, I'll just add a guestbook.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em>December 14th, 2018, 10:43 AM PST Update: </em>Yeah, this isn't going to happen anytime soon.</span></p>

I'm going to see if I have time to add more buttons to the archive.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">December 5th, 2017, 10:22 AM PST</span></strong><br /><span style="color: #00ccff;">Put 88x31 button archive onto sitemap. Also made first blog post. You're looking at it.</span></p>
